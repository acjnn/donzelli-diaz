	<p>
		I'm a software developer from Milano with Italian-Cuban heritage, currently working in the finance sector at ArcaFondi. My background spans backend development, database architecture, and music production under the alias AcjnN[1][5].
	</p>

	<p>
		My technical work focuses on integrating complex financial data systems, working with everything from PostgreSQL and MongoDB to graph databases like Neo4j. I've spent the last five years building scalable backend solutions, implementing AI-driven features using RAG with Azure OpenAI, and automating processes that handle millions of data points daily[2].

	<p>
		Outside of code, I produce music that blends classical training with electronic experimentation. Started with piano at six, later picking up guitar, drums, and bass. My production style tends toward polyrhythmic complexity with abrupt transitions and heavy sound design - influenced by everything from Chopin and Debussy to Noisia and Skrillex[5].
	</p>

	<p>
		I approach both programming and music with the same principles: technical precision combined with creative synthesis. Whether I'm architecting a database schema or layering distorted basslines over classical melodies, the goal is building something that works well and expresses authentic ideas[1][3].
	</p>

	<p>
		I value efficiency over complexity and believe in systematic approaches to problem-solving. I'm drawn to emerging technologies, particularly AI and procedural generation, but always with an eye toward practical implementation rather than hype and buzz-words[2][4].
	</p>

	<p>
		My work reflects a balance between technical mastery and creative expression - building robust systems while maintaining space for experimentation and innovation. This intersection of logic and artistry defines most of what I do, whether debugging financial algorithms or crafting unexpected musical transitions[1][3].
